* Hylium
Lighten up your UI automation. Get [[http://docs.hylang.org/en/stable/][Hy]] on Selenium.

*Hylium* is a Hy / Python library that uses Selenium and the power of LISP to make UI tests easier to write.

This is in an *alpha* state right now and should probably not be used yet.

** Getting Started
Hylium assumes you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7
- Pipenv
- geckodriver (the Selenium Firefox driver)

You can set it up in two ways:
- as a library
- using a virtual environment

*** Install as a library
To use this as a library, we can install it using =pip=.

After cloning and navigating to the directory, install =hylium= as a package:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  pip install .
#+END_SRC

This assumes that you are in a virtual environment for the project where you want to use Hylium.

You can now =(import hylium)= as you would any other libary.

*** Virtual Environment
In order to work on this, we need to set up a virtual environment. This project uses [[https://docs.pipenv.org][pipenv]] to manage packages and virtual environments.

After cloning and navigating to the directory, install the packages and setup/use the virtual environment:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  pipenv install
  pipenv shell
#+END_SRC

** Examples
The following are examples of setting up the browser, navigating to duckduckgo.com, searching for "Hello World", and then closing the browser:
*** Using the default selector
Hylium uses the CSS selector by default:
#+BEGIN_SRC hy
  (setv driver (start))
  (navigate "https://www.duckduckgo.com")
  (write "#search_form_input_homepage" "Hello World")
  (click "#search_button_homepage")
  (.quit driver)
#+END_SRC

*** Using a specified selector
Use =make-element= to create an element with your chosen selector.

To use the ID selector:
#+BEGIN_SRC hy
  (setv driver (start))
  (navigate "https://www.duckduckgo.com")
  (write (make-element by-id "search_form_input_homepage") "Hello World")
  (click (make-element by-id "search_button_homepage"))
  (.quit driver)
#+END_SRC

*** Using page objects
Hylium can help in the creation of page objects.

Use the =defelement= macro to create elements on a page:
#+BEGIN_SRC hy
  (defclass DdgHomePage [object]
    "The DuckDuckGo home page"
    (defelement search-input by-id "search_form_input_homepage")
    (defelement search-button by-id "search_button_homepage")

    (defn goto [self]
      (navigate "https://www.duckduckgo.com"))

    (defn search [self search-term]
      (write self.search-input search-term)
      (click self.search-button)))

  (setv driver (start))
  (setv ddg-home (DdgHomePage))
  (.goto ddg-home)
  (.search ddg-home "Hello World")
  (.quit driver)
#+END_SRC
