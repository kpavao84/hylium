* Hylium
Lighten up your UI automation. Get [[http://docs.hylang.org/en/stable/][Hy]] on Selenium.

A work in progress.

** Getting Started
*** Virtual Environment
In order to work on this, we need to set up a virtual environment. This project uses [[https://docs.pipenv.org][pipenv]] to manage packages and virtual environments.

After cloning and navigating to the directory, install the packages, and then setup/use the virtual environment: 
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  pipenv install
  pipenv shell
#+END_SRC

*** Install as a library
To use this as a library, we can install it using =pip=.

After cloning and navigating to the directory, install `hylium` as a package:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  pip install --user .
#+END_SRC
